**AIoptide: An AI-Driven Pipeline for Peptide Optimization**
AIoptide is a modular, scalable framework for rational protein–peptide optimization. Combining AI-based screening, GRAVY-based stability filtering, structural modeling, long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and machine learning–based binding scoring, AIoptide streamlines the design of peptide therapeutics, diagnostics, and biosensors.
